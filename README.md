# score_keeper_react

Simple project to test the just-learned React skills. The application uses an express backend (with endpoints for querying/updating a mongoDB database) and a React frontend.
The React frontend employs React router in order to keep the major components (such as the matches list, or the add/edit match forms) organized.
The frontend makes Axios requests to the backend for fetching info / updating info.
